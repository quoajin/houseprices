Houseprices Kaggle competition

Kaggle Competition project. This is a price regression problem.

I tried to compete clean and not abuse any of the bugs or exploits that were exposed on the competition community, like data leakage or repeated test values from original dataset. This sets me back in ranking, but I focus on learning and improving my skills.
